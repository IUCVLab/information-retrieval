An important application of ball trees is expediting nearest neighbor search queries, in which the objective is to find the k points in the tree that are closest to a given test point by some distance metric (e.g. Euclidean distance ). A simple search algorithm, sometimes called KNS1, exploits the distance property of the ball tree .
